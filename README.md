## Web Application

We use React to create the frontend, Spring Boot to create the backend, and MySQL as the database.

- **Frontend**: The frontend code can be found in [`Codes/WebAppliaction/Frontend/questionnaire`](./Codes/WebAppliaction/Frontend/questionnaire).

- **Backend**: The backend code can be found in [`Codes/WebAppliaction/Backend/questionnaire`](./Codes/WebAppliaction/Backend/questionnaire). 

- **Database Script**: The database script can be found in [`Codes/WebAppliaction/Backend/spacquestionnarie.sql`](./Codes/WebAppliaction/Backend/spacquestionnarie.sql).
  
Please refer to the individual README files in each directory for detailed instructions on setting up and running the frontend, backend, and database components of the application.
